Gaussian Process Library
========================
This is a simple Gaussian process (GP) library for Matlab. It provides a bunch of simple functions to do basic GP regression and classification, mostly aimed for research purposes. The library is by no means complete or stable and is most likely not suitable for generic purposes.


Covariance Functions
--------------------
Covariance kernels follow the general interface `Kx1x2 = gpk_xxx(x1, x2, theta1, theta2, ...)`, where `theta1`, `theta2`, etc. denote the kernels parameters. If omitted, the kernel parameters will be set to a default value (`1` in most cases, see the Matlab help text for the respective covariance function). In addition to the standard formulation of the covariance function, there are also functions for the spectral density (generally of the form `Sw = gpk_xxx_psd(w, theta1, theta2, ...)`) and state space representations (of the form `[A, B, C, Sw, Pinf] = gpk_xxx_ss(theta1, theta2, ...)`) for stationary covariance functions.

The following covariance functions are implemented:

* Squared exponential covariance function:
    * `gpk_se(x1, x2, ell, sigma2)`: Covariance function,
    * `gpk_se_psd(w, ell, sigma2)`: Power spectral density,
    * `gpk_se_ss(ell, sigma2, N)`: State space representation.
* Mat√©rn covariance function:
    * `gpk_matern(x1, x2, ell, sigma2, nu)`: Covariance function,
    * `gpk_matern_ss(ell, sigma2, nu)`: State space representation.
*

In addition to the standard formulation

Examples
--------
There are a bunch of examples implemented (see the folder `examples`). These are:

* `ex_gpc_toy.m`: Gaussian process classification example using the Laplace and Expectation Propagation approximations (re-implementation of the example in Section 3.7.2 of Rasmussen and Williams (2006)).
* `ex_matern_ss.m`: Example of using the Matern state space formulation for a spatio-temporal GP regression problem.
