Gaussian Process Library
========================
This is a simple Gaussian process (GP) library for Matlab. It provides a bunch of simple functions to do basic GP regression and classification, mostly aimed for research purposes. The library is by no means complete or stable and is most likely not suitable for generic purposes.

TODO
----
[ ] Adopt the naming convention gp_xx
[ ] Make a github repository with everything that is needed
